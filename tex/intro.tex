\subsection{How We Cook}
We use vegetable oil by default, with butter and olive oil for flavor and extra-virgin olive oil for salads/drizzling. I habitually cut the sugar in half when baking. We never peel vegetables unless they're coated in wax, like turnips; I'd rather roast unpeeled squash and scoop out the skins than peel them. We grow basil, oregano, sage, mint, and rosemary in window baskets.

Our kitchen is equipped with:
\begin{itemize}
 \item 2 cast iron skillets

\subsection{How To Read These Recipes}
The title of each recipe includes a summary on how the dish is cooked. Special equipment (e.g.\ cast iron skillet, 9\inch$\times$13\inch baking dish, stand mixer) are called out. If the oven is used, the temperature and baking time are listed; in all other cases, the time given is an estimate of the active cooking time. Temperatures are given in Fahrenheit and measurements are given in Imperial. Ingredients listed in () are optional.

I encourage you to read the entire recipe through before you start! I've tried to indicate where prep can happen in parallel but you know your own process best.

While I've tried to respect the source recipes, I've taken license to paraphrase and streamline them during transcription.
