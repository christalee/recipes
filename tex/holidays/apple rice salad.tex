 \freeform This recipe won a prize in January 1998 in the Healthful Side Dishes category. Since I hate celery, we usually skip it.

 \ing[2]{cups}{brown \& wild rice, cooked}
 \ing[2]{}{apples, chopped}
 \ing[\fr14]{cup}{sunflower seeds}
 \ing[\fr12]{cup}{dried cranberries}
 In a large mixing bowl, combine salad components.

 \ing[2]{tbsp.}{balsamic vinegar}
 \ing[1]{tbsp.}{olive oil}
 \ing[2]{tsp.}{honey}
 \ing[2]{tsp.}{brown or Dijon mustard}
 \ing[1]{clove}{garlic, chopped}
 \ing[\fr14]{tsp.}{salt}
 In a small bowl, whisk together the dressing.

 \newstep Pour the dressing over the salad, stirring gently to coat.

 \freeform Notes:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item If the salad will not be served immediately, dip the apples in lemon juice water, or chop and add them just before serving. The salad will keep well, covered and chilled.
 \end{itemize}
