\begin{recipe}{Molly's Coconut Cream}{mixer \hfill 1 hr.}{\textbf{Source:} Molly DeBlanc \hfill serves 4-6}
  \freeform This is a technique more than a recipe. It relies on the cream at the top of a can of coconut milk, so if you usually get a cheap low-fat brand, spring for the good stuff.

\ing[1]{can}{coconut milk}
Freeze the coconut milk for 1 hour, long enough to get cold but not so long that it freezes solid and bursts the can. Also chill a mixing bowl and beaters in the fridge or freezer.

\newstep Open the can and spoon out the solid white coconut fat, leaving the clear coconut milk in the can for another recipe (coconut curry or squash soup?). Whip the coconut cream until it forms soft peaks. If it looks melty, put everything in the fridge to cool off.

\ing{}{sugar}
Add sugar to taste. Serve immediately, with cake, or chill until needed.

\freeform Notes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If you're the sort to think ahead, you can chill everything in the fridge overnight.
  \item This can be tricky---keeping everything chilled is important. Don't despair, though, you can always give up and make pi\~na coladas.
  \item This recipe uses coconut milk, not coconut cream, which is over-sweetened and often stabilized with guar gum. Non-stabilized coconut cream might work, though---try it and let me know!
\end{itemize}
