  \freeform I've never met Marilyn, but I made this cake once and it was delicious, so here it is with Americanized quantities.

\ing[1\fr12]{cups}{white sugar}
\ing[3]{cups}{white flour}
\ing[\fr12]{cup}{cocoa}
\ing[2]{tsp.}{baking powder}
\ing[1]{tsp.}{salt}
Mix together all dry ingredients with a spoon or whisk. No substitutions!

\ing[\fr23]{cup}{light oil}
\ing[2]{tbsp.}{cider vinegar}
\ing[2]{cups}{water}
Add all wet ingredients and mix thoroughly.

\newstep Pour cake batter into ungreased baking dish(es). Bake, decorate (optional), and serve.

\freeform Notes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If you would like a layer cake, cut it in half and stack for a towering cake, or bake half the batter at a time and stack for a more reasonable height.
  \item The recipe recommends any vegetable oil, except olive oil; personally I think olive oil would be delicious but maybe unexpected on a birthday (cf.\ SK's olive oil cake)
  \item Vegan serving suggestions: chocolate ganache; almond honey cream \And berries; cocoa buttercream made vegan
\end{itemize}
