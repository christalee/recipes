 \freeform This granola is simple and flexible. We usually pick 2--3 from each category:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item nuts: cashews, almonds, walnuts, sesame seeds
  \item dried fruits: cranberries, apricots, dates, tamarind, raisins
  \item ground spices: ginger, citrus peel, chipotle, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom
 \end{itemize}

 \ing[3]{cups}{rolled oats}
 \ing[1]{cup}{nuts}
 \ing[\fr12]{cup}{wheat germ}
 \ing[\fr12]{cup}{flax seeds}
 \ing[1--2]{tsp.}{salt}
 \ing[2--3]{tsp.}{each spice}
 Mix dry ingredients (except fruit!) in a large bowl.

 \ing[\fr13]{cup}{olive oil}
 \ing[\fr13]{cup}{honey}
 Mix the honey and olive oil into the dry ingredients.

 \newstep Bake in an oiled pan, stirring every 30 min.\ until granola has browned. Let cool in pan.

 \ing[1]{cup}{dried fruit}
 Sprinkle dried fruit over the cool granola. Transfer to an airtight container. Enjoy with milk or yogurt.

 \freeform Notes:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item If you prefer, you can use chia instead of flax seeds. Molasses is quite tasty instead of honey, but makes it hard to judge when the granola is done.
  \item Definitely measure the oil before the honey. Definitely don't use steel-cut or instant oats.
 \end{itemize}
