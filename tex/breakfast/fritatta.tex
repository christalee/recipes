 \freeform We are Team Fritatta: so much less fussy than omelettes! Use a combination of leftovers and staples: carrots, peppers, mushrooms, greens, cauliflower, broccoli, potatoes\ldots If you're awake enough, add some coordinating herbs and spices; if you're hungover enough, skip the onion and definitely add the cheese.

 \ing[1]{}{onion}
 \ing[2--3]{cups}{veggies}
 \ing[1]{tbsp.}{garlic}
 Saute the onion and raw veggies, in order of toughness. Add garlic, salt, pepper, and cooked veggies and saute 5 min.\ more, until heated through.

 \ing[4]{}{eggs}
 \ing[1]{handful}{(herbs)}
 Beat the eggs in a bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and any herbs you're using.

 \newstep Pour the eggs into the skillet. Turn the heat to medium if it isn't already. Cook until the edges are set and bubbles start to form in the middle.

 \ing[\fr12]{cup}{cheese}
 Grate cheese over top, if using. Broil until fritatta is puffed and brown on top, checking every 5 min.

 \freeform Notes:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Follow your nose: the eggs can burn quickly if the stove is too high or you forget them under the broiler.
  \item Leftover roasted potatoes, refried and covered in eggs and cheese, is great for starting off a busy day.
  \item Cabot Seriously Sharp Cheddar is our go-to topping cheese; goat cheese, low-moisture mozzarella, and Gruyere also have their moments.
 \end{itemize}
