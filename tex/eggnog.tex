 \ing[1] {lb.} {sugar}
 \ing[2] {qt.} {milk}
 \ing[1] {qt.} {heavy cream}
 \ing[700] {mL} {Remy Martin VSOP cognac}
 Mix the sugar, milk, and cream into the egg yolks, then add the cognac.

 Whip the egg whites and fold gently into the eggnog.

 Grate nutmeg over top, stir gently, and serve.

 \freeform Notes:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Ingredients should be chilled before starting, and the finished eggnog should be kept cool; no one likes warm eggnog.
 \end{itemize}
