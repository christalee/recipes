 \freeform Notes:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item You can use dried shiitakes for part or all of the mushrooms in this recipe; rehydrate them in the pressure cooker with the barley, adding an extra 2--3 cups of water. Then slice and saute as written.
  \item NancyLee used to follow this recipe until the sauteed mushrooms, then assembled the soup the next day in the crock pot.
