  \freeform I prefer a vinaigrette to a mayonnaise. Here is a potato salad that gets dressed while hot and then cooled for picnicking.

\ing[6]{med.}{potatos}
Boil the potatos, unpeeled, in salted water until they are slightly resistant to a sharp knife. Drain in a colander, then slice \fr{14}\inch\, thick. Set aside in a covered bowl.

\ing[1]{cup}{onions, sliced}
\ing[\fr{23}]{cup}{water or stock}
\ing[\fr{13}]{cup}{olive oil}
\ing[1]{tbsp.}{white wine vinegar}
\ing[2]{tsp.}{spicy mustard}
\ing[2]{tsp.}{salt}
\ing[1]{tsp.}{pepper, freshly ground}
Combine vinaigrette ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Simmer over low heat for 5 min.

\ing[1]{tbsp.}{lemon juice}
Remove saucepan from the heat and add the lemon juice.

\newstep Pour the sauce over the potato slices, which should still be hot. Stir gently to coat all the potatos. Serve at room temperature.
