\begin{recipe}{Potato Latkes}{pressure cooker \hfill 30 min.}{\textbf{Source:} Daniel Bergey \hfill serves 8}
  \freeform A traditional dish for the Winter Solstice.

\ing[1]{}{potato}
Chop into large pieces and pressure cook in a steamer basket for 30 min. until very soft. Mash and set aside.

\ing[1]{}{onion}
Chop onion finely and set aside.

\ing[4--6]{}{potatos}
\ing[4]{}{eggs}
Grate potatos, 1--1\fr{12}\ at a time, right before frying to avoid browning. Squeeze the potatos by the handful or twist them in a cloth to remove as much moisture as possible. Mix with 1 egg and \fr{14}\ of both the chopped onion and the mashed potato. Salt and pepper to taste. Mix well by hand.

\newstep Heat vegetable oil in the skillet. Use 2--3 tbsp. of potato for each latke. Press flat with fingers or spatula. Repeat until skillet is full.

\newstep Fry on one side until brown, then flip and repeat. Serve hot, while starting the next batch.

\freeform Notes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To make these vegan, omit the eggs and increase the mashed potato to compensate. They will be more delicate.
  \item Latkes work best with russet potatos.
  \item Conventional accompaniments are sour cream, applesauce, and/or sauerkraut.
\end{itemize}
