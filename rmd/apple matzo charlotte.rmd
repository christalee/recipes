A perennial favorite at Passover.

* 4 matzos
- Soak matzos in water until soft. Drain and squeeze out excess water.

* 6 eggs, separated
* 1/4cup sugar
* 4 apples, sliced
* 1/2cup (almonds)
* 1/2cup (raisins)
* 1tbsp cinnamon
- Mix matzos with beaten egg yolks, sugar, apples, nuts, raisins, and cinnamon.

* 1/4cup butter
- Add butter, melted or chopped into small pieces.

* 6 egg whites
- Whip egg whites until stiff. Fold gently into apple-matzo mixture.
- Bake in a well-greased casserole until golden brown on top.

-- The original recipe suggests this can be served plain or "with lemon sauce", whatever that is.
-- Chop the apples while the matzos soak in the baking dish; dry and grease the baking dish later, while the egg whites are whipping.
