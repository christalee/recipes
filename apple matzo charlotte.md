A perennial favorite at Passover.

9x13 baking dish / 45 min. / 350 F / serves 12

* 4 matzos
- Soak matzos in water until soft. Drain and squeeze out excess water.

* 6 eggs, separated
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 4 apples, sliced
* 1/2 cup chopped or sliced almonds (optional)
* 1/2 cup raisins (optional)
* 1 tablespoon cinnamon
* 1/4 lb. (1 stick) butter
- Mix matzos with beaten egg yolks, sugar, apples, nuts, raisins, and cinnamon.
- Add butter, melted or chopped into small pieces.

* 6 egg whites
- Whip egg whites until stiff. Fold gently into apple-matzo mixture.

+ Bake in a well-greased casserole until golden brown on top.

Tips:
-- The original recipe suggests this can be served plain or "with lemon sauce", whatever that is.
-- Chop the apples while the matzos soak in the baking dish; dry and grease the baking dish later, while the egg whites are whipping.
